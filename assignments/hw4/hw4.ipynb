Further instructions are in _Part 2: Mini-project_. But, in general, you should feel free to try other architectures (HMMs, RNNs, transformers, state space layers, diffusion models etc.) or to invent new architectures. The goal will be to find some area of possible improvement (we interpret \"improvement\" quite loosely, but it is up to you to state precisely in what sense your proposed innovation might constitute an improvement and to show convincing evidence that your innovation does or does not constitue an improvement according to your definition); to formulate and state a precise hypothesis; and to falsify or support the hypothesis with rigorous empirical analyses.\n",

        "_Notes_: As this assignment is being treated as a project, you should expect training to take longer than previous assignments. However, please use your judgement to decide what is reasonable. We will not expect you to run training procedures that take more than 2 hours on the free Google Colab computing resources and we certainly do not expect you to acquire additional compute. The proposed improvements should not solely rely on increased computing demands, but must be based on the goal of improving the model by more efficiently learning from our data.\n",
